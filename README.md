## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on the FPGA-based implementation of custom cryptographic primitives. The primary goal was to explore the hardware design challenges involved in translating theoretical cipher architectures—specifically Non-Linear Feedback Shift Registers (NLFSR) and Unbalanced Feistel Networks—into physical Register Transfer Level (RTL) logic.

By mapping execution from software models to the Artix-7 FPGA fabric, this project demonstrates the principles of hardware acceleration, pipeline parallelism, and real-time clock synchronization in cryptographic systems.

## 🛠️ Key Engineering Features

* **🛡️ Hybrid Cryptographic Architecture**
  * Implemented a custom cipher that combines the speed of a Stream Cipher with the structural integrity of a Block Cipher using an Unbalanced Feistel Network structure.
* **🎲 Non-Linear Key Generation**
  * Designed a 7-bit NLFSR (Non-Linear Feedback Shift Register) with Boolean mixing functions to demonstrate logic-level mitigation against linear cryptanalysis.
* **⚡ Asynchronous Clock Synchronization**
  * Implemented explicit clock-gating and buffering to safely synchronize 9600-baud asynchronous UART data with the 100MHz system clock domain.
* **👁️ Multiplexed Telemetry Display**
  * Developed a custom hardware driver using Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM) to visualize internal cipher states on 7-segment displays via a shared bus.
* **🔄 Reversible Logic Core**
  * Leveraged the Feistel property ($A \oplus B \oplus B = A$) to utilize the exact same hardware logic gate array for both encryption and decryption modes.

## ⚙️ System Architecture
*The UART interface is used solely as a test and validation input mechanism and is not part of the cryptographic design itself.*
The system operates as a continuous pipelined data path:

### 1. Input Interface (`UART_RX`)
* **Protocol:** Standard RS-232 Serial (9600 Baud, 8N1).
* **Function:** Captures serial data from a PC/Keyboard and frames it into parallel 8-bit bytes.
* **Sync:** Generates a "Data Valid" pulse to trigger the encryption core for exactly one clock cycle.

### 2. The Core Engine (`Top_Level.vhd`)
* **Key Gen:** An NLFSR advances its state based on a non-linear feedback polynomial.
* **Split:** The 7-bit ASCII input is split into "Anchor" (3 bits) and "Target" (4 bits) segments.
* **Mix:** The Anchor and Key are fed into a boolean mixing function; the result is XORed with the Target.

### 3. Output Visualization (`TDM_Driver`)
* **Technique:** Persistence of Vision.
* **Mechanism:** A refresh timer cycles through the 4 digit anodes at 250Hz, creating the illusion that all displays are active simultaneously while reducing power and pin usage.

## 💻 Technical Implementation Details

#### 1. The Feistel Network (Diffusion)
To allow for complex, non-reversible mixing functions while maintaining the ability to decrypt, I implemented a Feistel structure.
* **The Logic:**
  $$Target_{new} = Target_{old} \oplus F(Anchor, Key)$$
  $$Anchor_{new} = Anchor_{old}$$
* **Hardware Efficiency:** Since the `Anchor` is preserved, the decryption module simply re-applies the same operation. This reduced the required FPGA LUT (Look-Up Table) usage by approx. 40% compared to separate Encrypt/Decrypt circuits.

#### 2. Non-Linear Feedback Shift Register (Confusion)
Standard LFSRs are vulnerable to linear algebra attacks. I upgraded the key generator to an NLFSR.
* **The Upgrade:** Instead of simple XOR taps, I introduced **AND/OR gates** into the feedback loop.
* **Mathematical Consequence:** This increases the linear complexity of the keystream, making the cipher significantly harder to predict without knowing the initial seed state.

#### 3. Hardware-Level Synchronization
The project involves crossing clock domains (Async Serial $\to$ Sync FPGA).
* **Solution:** I implemented a "Data Valid" flag system. The internal state machine remains idle until the UART module asserts `o_RX_DV`. The encryption logic then executes in a single 100MHz clock cycle, ensuring no data is dropped or processed twice.
